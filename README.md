### 👋 HI! Hey there, I'm Thasvarit (@touchvarit)!   
My name is Thasvarit (@touchvarit.) I study engineering during the day and read my favorite books at home at night.

What I'm doing now   
•  🎓 Freshman engineering student at [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/academic/faculty-of-engineering/) by day, and a curious mind diving into favorite books by night.   
•  💻 Former data analyst at [SPACE AC Institute of Tech](https://spaceac.net/), skilled in engineering simulation, 3D modeling, and basic stats analysis.  
•  📝 Writing at [Scale](https://scaleth.com/) and [QuantCorner](https://www.quant-corner.com/)  (both for less than three months as of January 2024)  
•  🌐 I Love "Show Your Work!" by Austin Kleon and [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) by xycd and trying to implement them on my Facebook account.  
•  📚 My hobby are reading Richard Feynman's books, creating abstract art, and enjoying SNES games.  
•  🚀 I've been passionate about data science since [my highschool year](https://www.facebook.com/touchvaritnote/posts/pfbid02VYhibs2ms6UYdQgPzgATLvr9ijMjRe6mbzY2j47NS8eDuW2eonc5YmBx9N6uTa2Ql) Recently, I successfully completed a [6-month Data Science Bootcamp](https://api.badgr.io/public/assertions/kw9eQA2TTCyQP9wrA3BZ7g?identity__email=thnote%40outlook.com) with DataRockie in 2023.  

Fun Fact: Despite my dad being an engineer, I never considered this faculty until my friend convinced me that engineers don't only build houses; they create anything they want!
