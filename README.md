### 👋 HI!, I'm Thasvarit (@touchvarit)   

What I'm doing now (Updated: 01-Feb-2024)  
•  🎓 Thai freshman engineering student   
•  📝 Writing at [Scale](https://scaleth.com/) and [QuantCorner](https://www.quant-corner.com/)  (both for less than three months as of January 2024)  
•  🌐 I Love "Show Your Work!" by Austin Kleon and [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) by Swyx and trying to implement them on my Facebook account.  
•  ✨ I use GitHub to open-source my learning journey, making it accessible for anyone—including myself—to revisit. The writing format draws inspiration from Vivatsathorn Thitasirivit work.  
•  📚 My hobby are reading Richard Feynman's books, creating abstract art, watching great emotional ads, and enjoying SNES games. I'm currently obsessed with playing Tetris Gaiden.

What I have done  
•  🚀 I've been passionate about data science since [my highschool year](https://www.facebook.com/touchvaritnote/posts/pfbid02VYhibs2ms6UYdQgPzgATLvr9ijMjRe6mbzY2j47NS8eDuW2eonc5YmBx9N6uTa2Ql) 
Recently, I successfully completed a [6-month Data Science Bootcamp](https://api.badgr.io/public/assertions/kw9eQA2TTCyQP9wrA3BZ7g?identity__email=thnote%40outlook.com) with DataRockie in 2023.   
•  💻 Former data analyst at [SPACE AC Institute of Tech](https://spaceac.net/), skilled in engineering simulation, 3D modeling, and basic stats analysis.
